### Biography

Hi! I’m Yixin Dong, a first-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tianqi Chen](https://tqchen.com/). I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Technology from the ACM Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and systems, with a growing interest in LLM Agents. As a dedicated advocate of open source, I have co-led and contributed to several notable projects, including [MLC-LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm) and [Apache TVM Unity](https://github.com/apache/tvm/tree/main), where I also serve as an Apache TVM Reviewer. I had the privilege of spending a wonderful time at the University of Washington, working with [Prof. Luis Ceze](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/luisceze).

Feel free to explore my [CV](https://github.com/Ubospica/Ubospica/blob/master/Resume.pdf) to learn more. I’m always open to collaborating with passionate, like-minded individuals.

Beyond research, I’m a cinephile and a lover of contemporary dance. My favorite movies are *Die Blechtrommel* and *Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo*. If you share similar interests, let’s grab a coffee and chat!
